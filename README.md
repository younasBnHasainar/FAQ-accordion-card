### Personal Notes

- Learnt Node nextSibling property : to select sibling element of an element using DOM API.

- Learnt
  DOMTokenList contains() method.
  We cant use includes method on DOMTokenList which is returned by Node.classList. We've to use contains()

- HTMLElement: dataset property. We can give customized attributes for html elements and can be manipulated same with Node.dataset property.
